Reference link on how Doctors diagnose Covid-19: [The role of chest radiography in confirming covid-19 pneumonia](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m2426#:~:text=Most%20people%20with%20covid%2D19,those%20with%20covid%2D19%20pneumonia.)

Relevant insight:

- "covid-19 pneumonia changes are mostly **bilateral on chest radiographs** (72.9%, 95% confidence interval 58.6 to 87.1) and have **ground glass opacity** in 68.5% of cases (95% CI 51.8 to 85.2)"
- The paper provides several images and analyzes them. From the images, it seems that the target areas are in the 4 corners of the lungs, perhaps data augmentation can perform crops to those areas

How it can be used in the model?

- Problem: The data classes are imbalanced for covid and non-covid and that the model has more problems differentiating the 2 compared to differentiating normal and infected.
  Solution: Since covid-19 is `bilateral` meaning that it affects both sides of the lungs at a high probability. Perhaps mirroring images could be a possible approach to increase the size of the dataset for covid images, giving the model a more balanced dataset and more covid images to recognize

Reference link: [How accurate is chest imaging for diagnosing COVID-19?](https://www.cochrane.org/CD013639/INFECTN_how-accurate-chest-imaging-diagnosing-covid-19)

- Defines X-Rays as "X-rays (radiography) use radiation to produce a 2-D image"
- This paper pooled results from several sources (if there were 4 or more results). For Chest X-rays, it found that the Chest X-ray "correctly diagnosed COVID-19 in 80.6% of the people who had COVID-19. However it incorrectly identified COVID-19 in 28.5% of the people who did not have COVID-19"

Critical insight

- It seems that classifications for X-rays have room for improvement, the numbers indicated above would provide a baseline for any model's performance

- "No single feature of covid-19 pneumonia on a chest radiograph is specific or diagnostic, but a combination of multifocal peripheral lung changes of ground glass opacity and/or consolidation, which are most commonly bilateral, may be present"
- "Diagnosis might be complicated as covid-19 pneumonia may or may not be visible on chest radiograph"
- "Most patients with covid-19 infection have a mild illness and do not develop pneumonia"
- Diagnose
  1. **"Like other pneumonias, covid-19 pneumonia causes the density of the lungs to increase**. This may be seen as **whiteness in the lungs** on radiography which, depending on the severity of the pneumonia, **obscures the lung markings** that are normally seen; however, this may be delayed in appearing or absent."
  2. "Review the radiograph systematically, looking for abnormalities of the **heart, mediastinum, lungs, diaphragm, and ribs**,[9](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m2426#ref-9) and remembering that radiographic changes of covid-19 pneumonia can be **subtle or absent**."
  3. "covid-19 pneumonia changes are mostly **bilateral on chest radiographs** (72.9%, 95% confidence interval 58.6 to 87.1) and have **ground glass opacity** in 68.5% of cases (95% CI 51.8 to 85.2)"
  4. "common manifestations and patterns of **lung abnormality** seen on portable chest radiography in covid-19 patients"
- How it can be used in the model?
  1. The paper provides several images and analyzes them. From the images, it seems that the target areas are in the 4 corners of the lungs, perhaps data augmentation can perform crops to those areas
  2. In addition, covid-19 is "bilateral" meaning that it affects both sides of the lungs at a high probability. Perhaps mirroring images could be a possible approach to increase the size of the dataset.

# 11. Common bug fixes

## Bug fix 1

**<u>Issue</u>**

Erroneous Code

```python
train_loss  = criterion(output, y_train_batch)
```

Error: `RuntimeError: 1D target tensor expected, multi-target not supported`

<u>**Background information**</u>

`criterion` is defined as `criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()`

Tensors were initialized as `[1 0 0]` in the dataset class' `__getitem`. This was then passed to the data loader in `train_loader = DataLoader(ld_train, batch_size = bs_val, shuffle = True)` for the respective train, validation, test.

**<u>Explanation</u>**

The following link at [Pytorch discussion - RuntimeError: multi-target not supported](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/runtimeerror-multi-target-not-supported-newbie/10216/3) explains it

This issue is caused by  because `CrossEntropyLoss` does not expect a one-hot encoded vector as the target, but class indices: The input is expected to contain scores for each class. Input has to be a 2D Tensor of size (minibatch, C). This criterion expects a class index (0 to C-1) as the target for each value of a 1D tensor of size minibatch

Example inputs

```python
loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
# Input: (N, C). C is the number of classes
input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
'''
tensor([[-0.9296, -0.6807,  0.1294,  0.0215,  1.1662],
        [-2.0247, -1.5964,  1.4188, -1.4765,  0.7276],
        [-0.3432, -2.3248,  0.2816, -0.4983, -0.7904]], requires_grad=True)
'''
target = torch.empty(3, dtype=torch.long).random_(5)
'''
tensor([2, 4, 1])
'''
output = loss(input, target)
'''
tensor(2.1256, grad_fn=<NllLossBackward>)
'''
```

**<u>Fix</u>**

**Possible fix 1:**

This fix was shown in the link. Change the loss to the following:

```python
loss = criterion(outputs, torch.max(y_train_batch, 1)[1])
```

What `torch.max` does. Refer to [PyTorch docs TORCH.MAX](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.max.html)

```python
for k, v in train_loader:
    print(v)
    '''
    tensor([[0., 1., 0.],
        [1., 0., 0.],
        [0., 1., 0.],
        [0., 1., 0.]])
    '''
    print(torch.max(v))
    '''
    tensor(1.)
    '''
    print(torch.max(v,1))
    '''
    values=tensor([1., 1., 1., 1.]),
    indices=tensor([1, 0, 1, 1]))
    '''
    print(torch.max(v,1)[1])
    '''
    tensor([1, 0, 1, 1]) 
    # this is the index of the max value per sample in the batch
    # example: first sample, the max is at index 1. Hence the first element in the tensor
    indicates that sample 1's max is at index 1
    '''
    # Forced stop
    break
```
